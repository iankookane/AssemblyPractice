# AssemblyPractice
Because I usually work with higher level languages, I decided to brush up on assembly learned in classes, however using Intel instead of MIPS. Exercises based off of Low-Level Programming by Igor Zhirkov https://github.com/Apress/low-level-programming  although solutions exist inside the git repo, I plan on not looking at them.  If I do end up looking at them because I have no tutor, then I will document it in a comment.  Thanks for looking at my work.
