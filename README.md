# AssemblyPractice
Because I usually work with higher level languages, I decided to brush up on assembly learned in classes, however using Intel instead of MIPS. Why learn assembly?  Well although most of my work is in Java, Python and Javascript, I am fascinated by the computer.  How it works, and why engineers designed it that way. 

Exercises based off of Low-Level Programming by Igor Zhirkov https://github.com/Apress/low-level-programming  although solutions exist inside the git repo, I plan on not looking at them.  If I do end up looking at them, then I will document it in a comment.  Thanks for looking at my work.
